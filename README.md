# DNA, RNA, Peptide Sequence Analysis Project

Welcome to the DNA, RNA, Peptide Sequence Analysis Project repository. This project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks to conduct a comprehensive analysis of DNA sequences using various machine learning classifiers. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.8 or later is recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

   - Install the necessary Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Downloading the Dataset

The datasets for this project are hosted externally. Follow these steps to obtain them:
- Visit the iLearnPlus data repository on GitHub. Link (https://github.com/Superzchen/iLearnPlus/tree/main/data)
- Download the required datasets into the `data` folder of this repository.

## Running the Notebooks

To analyze the DNA sequences using the provided Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   - Open your command line interface and start Jupyter Notebook.
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the `DNA_DATASET.ipynb` notebook and other two.
3. Execute the notebook cells:
   - You can run the cells one by one or use the "Run All" option from the "Cell" menu in Jupyter Notebook.

## Notebooks Description
